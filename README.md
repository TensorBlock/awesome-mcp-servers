# Awesome MCP Servers ![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Model Context Protocol

MCP is like a USB-C port for AI. It’s an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to language models — enabling them to securely connect to tools, databases, APIs, filesystems, and more.

## Coverage

This repo currently includes coverage for 4663 MCP servers as of April 7, 2025. Due to the limited space, we only show the most recent 30 servers in each category.
